# EricBot

Project to build a 2 wheeled robot using:
- Arduino for low level control
	- ISR to read encoders
	- MotorControl class for clean code
	- 2 pins for direction control
	- PWM for speed control

- ROS for high level control
	- Kinematics
	- PID tuning
	
This is my CIS-600 - Masters Project for UMass Dartmouth
